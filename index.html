            <p>Payment is non-refundable once plans are issued due to the custom nature of the work and time put into writing each individualized program. No refunds will be issued during our time together due to the nature of intellectual property provided as well as the 24/7 ongoing support that comes with coaching. It is the client's responsibility to cancel any subscriptions should they no longer wish to continue. Programs will not be hosted online after our time together is up and it is the client's responsibility to save their programs should they wish to. Check-ins are the client's responsibility. If you do not check in yet do not cancel payments, your spot as a client will be maintained until payments are canceled. Client openings are limited, so maintaining payments may be used to hold your spot as a client at my discretion.</p>
